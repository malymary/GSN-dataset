# GSN_dataset

The dataset was created with the aim of reproducing the experimental results of ["GSN: A Graph-Structured Network for Multi-Party Dialogues"](https://github.com/morning-dews/GSN-Dialogues) by transforming the [Molweni Dataset](https://github.com/HIT-SCIR/Molweni).

**GSN_dataset** folder stores the dataset as three separate sets: training, validation, and testing.

**molweni_for_gsn** folder stores the input data and code necessary to create the dataset.
